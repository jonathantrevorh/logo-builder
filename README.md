logo-builder
============

Utilize &lt;canvas> api to draw shapes to form a logo for Techathlon, a (fingers crossed) upcoming event for students at Tech. 

I tried to build it the logo in GIMP. Then gave it a go in Inkscape. Both weren't providing the tools to build the logo how I imagined in my head. So, the shapes and transformations became equations and loops over pixels of a &lt;canvas>. Result is rendered in-browser upon loading index.html.
